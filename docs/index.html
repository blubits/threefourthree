<h1>TR3S</h1>
<p> TR3S is a spin-off of the popular '2048' game. Instead of using the powers of 2, we used the powers of 3.</p>
<br>
<h1>How to play</h1>
<ul>
  <li>You will start with two tiles on the board. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles.</li>
  <li>Tiles move as far as possible in the direction that you pressed. A new tile will be placed randomly on the board.</li>
  <li>You need three tiles of the same number to line up and slide together to form a new tile.</li>
  <li>You win the game when you have reached the tenth power of 3 which is 54049</li>
  <li>You lose the game if the board is filled with tiles and there are no other possible moves.</li>
</ul>
